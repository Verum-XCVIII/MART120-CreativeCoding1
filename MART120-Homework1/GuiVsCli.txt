This may simply be my aversion to change, or just because I’m not used to it, but, using a command-line interface simply seems far too clunky and slow to consider using over a graphical user interface. I’ve only read through the first three chapters of Unix for the Beginning Mage, so I may be missing out on some of the more advanced features, but, a couple of examples of advantages of a GUI are that it allows the user to view thumbnail previews of images and the organization of files can be changed in a number of different ways. And, the biggest issue I find with the command-line interface is needing to remember all of the different commands used. I realize that after enough use one would come to memorize all of the commonly used commands, but it just seems unnecessary when we have GUIs. Others may find some use for a command-line interface, but I can’t find any reason to personally use it over a GUI. I apologize for being rather negative with my response, but a GUI simply seems like a significant upgrade over the command-line interface to me.

(p.s. I’m not sure what length would classify as a “short paper”, but I don’t really have much else to say.)
