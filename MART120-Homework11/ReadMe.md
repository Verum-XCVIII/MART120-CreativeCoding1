Here's just some basic information to explain the different files, most of this information is also at the top of the .js files in comments, but, I figured I'd add it here too, just in case.


###Quick breakdown on the different .js files:

 - The sketch.js file (index) is the closest to being an actual game with enemies and the ability to win (though not lose just yet). And I suppose it's mostly just based off of Pacman.

 - The sketch2.js (index2) file was created in case I broke everything while testing "physical" collision, and in achieving such I also made a (mostly) functional cell coordinate system.

 - The sketch3.js (index3) file was created when I thought to use my cell coordinate system to make grid based movement, and I ended up also trying to make objects the player could break. And, if you were wondering what I had in mind for this, I've recently started playing Old School RuneScape for the first time, so that's the inspiration.

 - Lastly sketchTesting.js was simply made while going through the tutorials, and I also put some failed attempts in there if you wish to look at that.
