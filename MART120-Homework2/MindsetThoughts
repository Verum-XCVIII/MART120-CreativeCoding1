	Honestly I had some difficulty with the quiz, as I got very hooked up on the term “intelligence”. It’s a difficult word to really define, and many questions seemed to imply an all-encompassing intelligence, meaning a smart person is good at everything, which isn’t true. I ended up with a score of 38, meaning I have a growth mindset with some fixed ideas. Though more accurately I would say my opinion is that personal qualities can be changed, effort can outperform talent, and you can learn from your mistakes, it’s just all very difficult to do. However, in my opinion, the far more difficult matter to overcome is that of motivation. Also, there was one short quote from your video that I really liked and feel I need to remember, “Focus on the journey”. I have a tendency to focus on the “end goal”, thinking only of how much better I need to be if I wish to ever get a job making video games, which is always very demoralizing. And sometimes I just need to remember to focus more on the present than the future.
