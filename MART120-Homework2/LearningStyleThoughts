	I ended up getting 5% auditory, 35% visual, and 60 % tactile, and while I did expect visual and tactile to be decently higher than audio, I would have guessed that the percentages would be closer with tactile only slightly higher than visual. It does make sense considering how much I hate watching videos for class though. I just can’t stand having to simply sit there and watch, and if I try doing anything while watching a video it would just become background noise and I’d need to rewatch it, I’d much rather just read the information and look at pictures. Looking at the description for tactile learner then, I’d say most statements do apply to me, except that I have terrible athletic ability, do not communicate by touching, and I absolutely hate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back.
  I’m not really sure what I could do to optimize my learning for this class, especially since I don’t exactly know what we’ll be doing yet. However, as for how you could help, as you may have already guessed, video’s just don’t do it for me. It’s obviously ridiculous to request that you remove the videos, as I’m sure there are those who find them very useful, but it would be nice if the longer and/or more important videos had transcripts that could be read instead. Largely because I can remember information far better if I read it rather than hear it, and being able to quickly re-read a sentence two or three times is important to me. Sorry if it seems like I’m complaining, it’s just that I got a lot of footage to sit through this week.
