	I’m honestly not any good at analyzing how something makes me “feel”, perhaps I’m just not that emotional, so I don’t know if I can comment much on that front. However, I did find the lecture very interesting and enjoyable to listen to. In particular his discussion on early VR technology and the building virtual worlds course he held were very interesting to me. And there was one thing in particular that caught my interest when he was discussing this building virtual worlds class and the Entertainment Technology Center. That was the principle idea of bringing together the artists and the technologists to work together and make things. How he described these principles reminded me a lot of the ideals behind our university’s Innovation Factory, which I had the pleasure of being an intern for during the Fall semester of 2019.
	Otherwise, while I did find his messages to be interesting and good advice to live by, I wouldn’t say any one message in particular really jumped out at me. His discussion at the end about if one leads their life the right way the dreams will come to them was an interesting insight. And I also liked his message of how brick walls exist for people to prove how badly they want something, as I feel most other life advice lectures I’ve been made to listen/read in school state that there are no walls. They try to convince you that any wall you come across is self imposed, which only makes you feel that much worse when you come across one in my opinion. Lastly, I just wanted to state that, while my writing may suggest an indifference towards the lecture, I did truthfully enjoy it far more than I expected to, I’m simply not very good with these kinds of assignments.
